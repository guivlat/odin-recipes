        <h1>"Chef" Pasta Aglio e Olio</h1>
        <img src="https://jbf-media.s3.amazonaws.com/production/recipe/2018/12/12/JBF%20Aglio%20e%20Olio_Judy%20Kim.%20web.jpg" alt="spaghetti">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta aglio e olio translates to spaghetti with garlic and oil in Italian. This is another dish that <em>Chef</em> took and highlighted in a scene where Carl Casper (actor Jon Favreau) cooks and serves it to his restaurant hostess/girlfriend, Molly (actor Scarlett Johansson). In what can only be described as food seduction, Casper is seen moving around the kitchen while Molly watches on, with not a word exchanged between the two. This movie highlighted how transcendence can be achieved through a handful of humble ingredients turned into a bowl of pasta.</p>
